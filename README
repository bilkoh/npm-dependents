# This is what I use when looking to investigate the ramifications of a 
# vulnerable package in node.
# I couldn't figure out how to do so via `npm view`, so I wrote this.
# There's probably a better way, but whatever.
#
# Here's the usage for finding out which packages use mem, whose <4.0.0 version
# is vulnerable to DoS (see: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html):
#
# ./npm-depdents.sh mem
